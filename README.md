© ExploreAI Academy

In this coding challenge, we will apply all of the skills we learned in Pandas.

⚠️ **Note that this code challenge is graded and will contribute to your overall marks for this module. Submit this notebook for grading. Note that the names of the functions are different in this notebook. Transfer the code in your notebook to this submission notebook**

### Instructions

- **Do not add or remove cells in this notebook. Do not edit or remove the `### START FUNCTION` or `### END FUNCTION` comments. Do not add any code outside of the functions you are required to edit. Doing any of this will lead to a mark of 0%!**

- Answer the questions according to the specifications provided.

- Use the given cell in each question to see if your function matches the expected outputs.

- Do not hard-code answers to the questions.

- The use of StackOverflow, Google, and other online tools is permitted. However, copying a fellow student's code is not permissible and is considered a breach of the Honour code. Doing this will result in a mark of 0%.

# Introduction

Hey there, I'm glad you're on board for the Maji Ndogo project AGAIN! Let me walk you through what we're up against and how we'll tackle it.

As you know, we're in an ambitious project aimed at automating farming in Maji Ndogo, a place with diverse and challenging agricultural landscapes. Before we dive into the 'how' of farming, we need to figure out the 'where' and 'what'. It's not just about deploying technology; it's about making informed decisions on where to plant specific crops, considering factors like rainfall, soil type, climate, and many others.

Our analysis is the groundwork for this entire automation project. We have an array of variables like soil fertility, climate conditions, and geographical data. By understanding these elements, we can recommend the best locations for different crops. It's a bit like solving a complex puzzle – each piece of data is crucial to seeing the bigger picture.

We'll start by importing our dataset into a DataFrame. It is currently in an SQLite database, and split into tables. Unlike Power BI or SQL, data analysis in Python happens in a single table. So we will have to brush off those dusty SQL skills to get the data imported. Expect a bit of a mess in the data – it's part of the challenge. We need to clean it up and maybe reshape it to make sense of it. It's like sorting out the tools and materials we need and getting rid of what we don't.

Here's where the real fun begins. We'll dive deep into the data, looking for patterns, and correlations. Each clue in the data leads us closer to understanding the best farming practices for Maji Ndogo. I'll be relying on your skills and insights. We'll be working through these steps together, discussing our findings and strategies.

Let's gear up and get ready to make a real difference in Maji Ndogo. Ready to get started? Let's dive into our data and see what stories it has to tell us.

Sanaa.
